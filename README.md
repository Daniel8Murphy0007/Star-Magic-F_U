Aetheric Propulsion (UQFF-Unified Quantum Field Force) has been developed in a low energy laboratory in Ohio since 2010, initially to discover the hiddens secrets of hydrogen and helium.
This is a Field Unification challenge to MOND, Lambda-ACM, and the host of others!
UQFF has been rigorously valdate against updated data from all of all current top classification models and high energy datasets from all majors worldwide, yet still remain unpublished until now.
This system begins with an equation of the nucleus of an atom and is linked to cosmological, astronomical, and astrophysical; to unify quantum dynamics.
This system unifies all known mathematical systems and provides stable 26th level polynomial predictive potentials.
This system is a compact quantum calculator, that will be capable of distinguishing real from fake; capable of organic code growth(e.g., self_OS) and self implimentation  /arrangement according to the "starting-input-command-set" along with subject/robot continual neural/wifi-5 feedback.
