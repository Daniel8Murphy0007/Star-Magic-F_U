# Star-Magic: Unified Quantum Field Force (UQFF) Project

This project implements the theoretical framework for **Aetheric Propulsion** and **Unified Quantum Field Force** theory, developed since 2010 as a field unification challenge to existing models.

## Project Architecture

### Core Components
- **`index.js`**: Minimal Node.js entry point (`console.log` and `node OK`)
- **`README.md`**: High-level project overview and introduction
- **`Star-Magic.md`**: Comprehensive theoretical documentation containing the complete UQFF mathematical framework

### Theoretical Framework (Star-Magic.md)
The project centers on a unified field equation that combines four fundamental force components:

1. **Universal Gravity (∆Ug_i)**: Four discrete ranges (Ug1-Ug4) including:
   - Ug1: Internal dipole strength driving stellar irregularities
   - Ug2: Spherical outer field bubble forming heliospheres
   - Ug3: Magnetic strings disk maintaining planetary orbits
   - Ug4: Observable star-black hole interactions

2. **Universal Magnetism (Um)**: Near-lossless magnetic strings from superconductive material (SCm)

3. **Universal Buoyancy (Ub_i)**: Opposes gravity ranges, influenced by galactic spin

4. **Universal Cosmic Aether (UA)**: Background medium for all interactions

### Key Scientific Concepts
- **SCm (Superconductive Material)**: Dense, undetectable element bound in every atom and star
- **26 Quantum Energy Levels**: E_n = E_0 × 10^n scale structure
- **π Cycles & Negative Time**: Temporal components for quantum-gravitational bridging
- **Reactor Efficiency**: Models quasar jets and planetary cores as efficient reactors

## Development Patterns

### File Organization
- Keep theoretical documentation in `Star-Magic.md` using detailed mathematical notation
- Use `index.js` for any computational implementations
- Scientific constants and equations should reference real astronomical data (Sun, Milky Way, etc.)

### Mathematical Notation
- Use Greek letters and subscripts extensively: ∆Ug_i, ρ_vac, ω_s, etc.
- Include units in calculations (kg, m, s, T for Tesla)
- Reference specific astronomical objects: Sagittarius A*, solar mass M_s = 1.989×10^30 kg
- Incorporate 11-year solar cycles and differential rotation in models

### Coding Approach
- When implementing calculations, maintain scientific rigor with proper unit conversions
- Use precise astronomical constants from the documentation
- Consider time-dependent variables: solar cycles, galactic rotation, decay rates
- Model discrete force ranges rather than continuous functions

## Critical Context for AI Agents

### This is NOT a standard software project:
- Primary focus is theoretical physics and mathematical modeling
- Minimal codebase with extensive mathematical documentation
- Aims to address Millennium Prize Problems (Navier-Stokes, Yang-Mills)
- Connects quantum mechanics with cosmological observations

### When working on this project:
- Respect the detailed mathematical framework in `Star-Magic.md`
- Any code should support or validate the theoretical equations
- Consider connections to astronomical observations and data
- Maintain scientific notation and precision in calculations
- Reference the unified field equation: F_U = Σ_i[k_i ∆Ug_i - β_i ∆Ug_i Ω_g M_bh/d_g E_react] + ...

### External Dependencies & Data Sources
- Solar observation data (sunspot cycles, magnetic fields)
- Galactic parameters (Milky Way rotation, Sagittarius A* mass)
- Kepler Orrery V data references for planetary correlations
- Quasar jet observations for fluid dynamics validation

This project represents cutting-edge theoretical physics research rather than traditional software development.
